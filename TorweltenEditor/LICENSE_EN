                      Torwelten Editor v.0.0
=======================================================================

This software is a character generator and toolbox for the pen and
paper roleplaying universe "Torwelten" http://www.torwelten.com
Author of this program is Eric Pöhlsen: https://www.eric-poehlsen.de

The program in its present state is provided free of cost and
"open-source". The author does not give any warranty concerning the
usability and security of this software.

The program is written in Python 3.6 and uses a number of different
libraries and modules:

It uses 'tkinter' for rendering the GUI with Tcl/Tk. 'ElementTree'
is used to handle the XML parsing. Image imports are using the Python
Imaging Library PIL (You can use Pillow as well).

PDF exports are realized using the open-source-module 'ReportLab':

A compiled Microsoft Windows executable stand-alone version of this
software is created using 'Py2Exe': http://www.py2exe.org/
[with Python 3.4 at the moment]

Any program routines written by me are to be regarded as 'open-source'
they may be used as inspiration and can be copied in small bits without
explicit attribution. I only ask you not to distribute only slightly
modified derivatives of the full program.

If you liked my inspiration I'd appreciate links to my website
